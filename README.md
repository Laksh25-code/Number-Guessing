# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (C++)

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, a simple C++ console application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This project is great for beginners learning about conditionals, loops, and random number generation in C++.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program provides a hint:
   - "Too low" if the guess is lower than the number.
   - "Too high" if the guess is higher than the number.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
5. Once guessed correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed.
